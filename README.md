# Inventory Management & Product Tracking

This repository was created for my internship project at ONSSA ("Office national de sécurité sanitaire des produits alimentaires" or National Office for the Sanitary Safety of Food Products). It aims to streamline and facilitate various aspects of an inventory director's duties:

- **Tracking Products**: Monitor product movement, including who it was sent to, the quantity, whether it was purchased, requested, or destroyed.
  
- **Communication with Departments**: Facilitate easy communication with different departments, particularly the "Destruction Department" for handling outdated products.
  
- **Employee Requests Management**: Manage employee requests by accepting, refusing, or adjusting the quantity.
  
- **Collaboration with Other Inventory Directors**: Enable communication with other inventory directors to request or fulfill product requests.

## Technologies Used:
The project was built in PHP, with the database managed using SQL. I utilized both PhpMyAdmin and MySQL to verify SQL queries and view the data.
